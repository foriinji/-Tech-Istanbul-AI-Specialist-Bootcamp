Hello Everyone;

I'm thrilled to share a project I worked on during Dr. Murat Altun's "Artificial Intelligence Specialization Bootcamp" at Tech Ä°stanbul!!!

I recently worked on a fascinating project where I created an interactive before-after image slider using the leaf map library in Python. This tool is an excellent way to highlight changes over time by allowing users to visually compare two images.



Technical details:

Libraries Used: leaf map to create the interactive slider.

Platform: Google Colab for coding and execution
